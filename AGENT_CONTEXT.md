# Quick Context for Next Agent

## TL;DR
✅ **SUCCESS**: We built a working Flutter iOS app that calls Python via subprocess
❌ **FAILED**: PythonKit approach crashed repeatedly
🔄 **PIVOT**: Switched to subprocess approach - much simpler and reliable

## What Works
- Flutter UI → Swift Method Channel → Python Subprocess → Result back to Flutter
- App builds and runs without crashes
- Python script executes and returns result (2) successfully
- Clear debug output showing full execution flow

## Key Files (All in main project, NOT nested directory)
- `ios/Runner/PythonMinimalRunner.swift` - Subprocess implementation
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` - Method channel setup  
- `ios/Runner/Resources/minimal.py` - Python script
- `lib/main.dart` - Flutter UI

## Commands
```bash
cd /Users/chaos/dev/PythonDartSwiftMinimalTest
flutter run -d C7D05565-7D5F-4C8C-AB95-CDBFAE7BA098  # iOS Simulator
```

## What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't try PythonKit again
- ❌ Don't use the nested `python_flutter_embed_demo` directory
- ❌ Don't try to embed Python framework

## What TO Do
- ✅ Use subprocess approach for Python integration
- ✅ Test on iOS Simulator first
- ✅ Extend to send JSON data to Python
- ✅ Bundle Python executable with app for production

## Current Test Results
```
flutter: 🔔 Dart: _callPython() called
🔔 Swift: MethodChannel received call: addOneAndOne
🔍 PythonMinimalRunner: Starting subprocess call
🔍 Python output: 2
✅ Successfully got result: 2
flutter: 🔔 Dart: Python result: 2
```

## Next Steps
1. Embed Python executable (not system Python)
2. Send complex data (JSON) to Python
3. Add error handling
4. Optimize performance

## Files to Read
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Complete project status
- `.cursorrules` - Updated rules for this project
- `README.md` - Updated documentation

The subprocess approach is working perfectly and is the right solution for this use case.
