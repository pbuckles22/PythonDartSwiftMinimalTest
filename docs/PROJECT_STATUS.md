# Flutter Minesweeper with Python Integration - Project Status

## 🎯 **Current Status: ✅ TRUE 50/50 DETECTION WORKING**

### **Major Achievement: True 50/50 Detection Complete**
- **✅ Python Integration**: Embedded Python working with proper environment setup
- **✅ 50/50 Detection**: Sophisticated algorithm finds true 50/50 pairs
- **✅ Dart Validation**: Post-processing ensures only valid pairs are accepted
- **✅ Safe Move Implementation**: 50/50 safe move functionality working
- **✅ UI Integration**: Visual indicators for 50/50 cells and safe moves

### **Current Challenge: Mine Number Calculation**
**Issue**: When a mine is revealed during 50/50 safe move, the cell appears blank with no number
**Requirement**: Calculate what number should be displayed in the mine cell
**Safety Constraints**: 
- Must be minimal blast radius (only affect the specific cell)
- Only for last single cell revealed during 50/50 safe move
- Must maintain game consistency

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Python Integration (✅ Working)**
- **Embedded Python**: Bundled Python executable in iOS app
- **Environment Setup**: Proper `PYTHONPATH` and module discovery
- **50/50 Detection**: `find_5050_situations_simple()` algorithm
- **Side-adjacent Logic**: Only accepts cells that are side-adjacent (not corner-adjacent)
- **Multiple Pairs**: Can find and return multiple 50/50 pairs in one call

### **Dart Validation (✅ Working)**
- **Post-processing**: `_findTrue5050Pairs()` validates Python results
- **Shared Neighbor Check**: Ensures both cells in pair share a revealed neighbor
- **Board State Integration**: Uses actual game state for validation
- **Debug Logging**: Clear output showing validation results

### **Safe Move Implementation (✅ Working)**
- **50/50 Safe Move**: `perform5050SafeMove()` selects one cell from validated pair
- **Game State Update**: Properly updates board state after safe move
- **UI Feedback**: Shows safe move completion and game status

## 🔧 **Key Implementation Files**

### **Swift Files**
- `ios/Runner/PythonMinimalRunner.swift` - Subprocess implementation
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` - Method channel setup

### **Python Files**
- `ios/Runner/Resources/minimal.py` - Python script that prints result
- `ios/Runner/Resources/find_5050.py` - 50/50 detection logic
- `ios/Runner/Resources/core/` - Sophisticated CSP/Probabilistic solver files

### **Flutter Files**
- `lib/main.dart` - UI and method channel calls
- `lib/presentation/providers/game_provider.dart` - Game state management
- `lib/presentation/providers/settings_provider.dart` - Settings management
- `lib/services/native_5050_solver.dart` - Python integration bridge

## 🎮 **User Experience**

### **Current Working Features**
- **50/50 Detection**: Automatically finds true 50/50 situations during gameplay
- **Visual Indicators**: Orange borders and help icons on 50/50 cells
- **Safe Move**: Lightning bolt button to safely reveal one cell from 50/50 pair
- **Real-time Updates**: Detection updates as game state changes
- **Validation**: Only shows true 50/50 situations (no false positives)

### **Current Issue**
- **Mine Display**: When a mine is revealed during safe move, it appears blank instead of showing a number

## 🚀 **Development Commands**

```bash
# Run on iOS Simulator
flutter run -d C7D05565-7D5F-4C8C-AB95-CDBFAE7BA098

# Run on iOS Device
flutter run -d 00008130-00127CD40AF0001C

# Run tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/unit/game_provider_test.dart

# Run test runner script
./test_runner.sh
```

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **✅ Achieved**
- ✅ App builds without errors
- ✅ Flutter UI displays correctly
- ✅ Python integration working end-to-end
- ✅ 50/50 detection identifies real 50/50 situations
- ✅ Feature flags work correctly
- ✅ Settings persist correctly
- ✅ **True 50/50 detection with validation**
- ✅ **50/50 safe move functionality**
- ✅ **Visual feedback for 50/50 cells**

### **🔄 In Progress**
- 🔄 Mine number calculation for revealed mines
- 🔄 Safety constraints for mine calculation

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Priority**
1. **Implement Mine Number Calculation**: Add logic to calculate proper number for revealed mine cells
2. **Safety Constraints**: Ensure calculation only happens for 50/50 safe moves
3. **Minimal Impact**: Limit calculation to only the specific mine cell
4. **Testing**: Verify calculation accuracy and game consistency

### **Technical Approach**
- **CopyTo Logic**: Implement in the copyTo area for minimal blast radius
- **Single Cell Only**: Only calculate for the last single cell revealed during 50/50 safe move
- **Game Consistency**: Ensure the calculated number maintains game logic integrity

## 📝 **Conclusion**

The project has achieved a major milestone with working true 50/50 detection and safe move functionality. The current challenge of mine number calculation is a refinement that will improve the user experience by showing proper numbers for revealed mines during safe moves.

**Status: True 50/50 detection working, implementing mine number calculation for revealed mines.**
