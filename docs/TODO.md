## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 🔥 CRITICAL: Fix 50/50 Safe Move
**Issue**: The 50/50 safe move feature is enabled but doesn't actually prevent death.

**Current Behavior**: 
- User clicks orange 50/50 cell
- App calls `execute5050SafeMove()`
- Method just does regular `revealCell()` 
- User can still die if they hit a mine

**Required Fix**:
- Implement proper safe move logic that either:
  1. Reveals the safe cell instead of the clicked cell, OR
  2. Moves the mine to the other orange cell
- Add proper board state analysis
- Prevent crashes during analysis

### 🔧 MEDIUM: Hide Unimplemented Features
**Issue**: Settings UI shows toggles for features that don't work.

**Solution**: 
- Hide toggles for unimplemented features
- Add "Coming Soon" indicators
- Only show implemented features

### 📋 LOW: Implement Missing Features
**Priority Order**:
1. **Undo Move** - High user value, moderate complexity
2. **Hint System** - High user value, moderate complexity  
3. **Auto Flag** - High user value, high complexity
4. **Board Reset** - Medium user value, low complexity
5. **Dark Mode** - Medium user value, moderate complexity
6. **Best Times** - Medium user value, low complexity
7. **Custom Difficulty** - Low user value, moderate complexity
8. **Animations** - Low user value, high complexity
9. **Sound Effects** - Low user value, moderate complexity
10. **ML Assistance** - Low user value, very high complexity
11. **Auto Play** - Low user value, very high complexity
12. **Difficulty Prediction** - Low user value, very high complexity

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Fix 50/50 Safe Move** (Critical) - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Now uses repository method
2. **Hide unimplemented feature toggles** (Medium)
3. **Implement Undo Move** (High priority)
4. **Implement Hint System** (High priority)
5. **Add "Coming Soon" indicators** (Low priority)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION

**ALWAYS CHECK `ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md` BEFORE IMPLEMENTING NEW FEATURES**

This comprehensive architecture document prevents:
- Code duplication (like the 50/50 safe move issue we just fixed)
- Architecture violations
- Feature flag conflicts
- Repository pattern violations
- Immutable state violations

**Key Lesson Learned**: The `perform5050SafeMove` method already existed in the `GameRepository` interface and was fully implemented in `GameRepositoryImpl`. We should have checked the repository interface first instead of implementing our own bomb-moving logic in the provider.

## NOTES

- All feature flags are properly connected to SettingsProvider
- All toggles update FeatureFlags correctly
- The issue is that most features are only defined, not implemented
- 50/50 Safe Move is the only "broken" implemented feature
