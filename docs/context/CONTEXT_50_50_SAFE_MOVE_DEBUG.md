# 50/50 Safe Move Debug Context

## Current Status: ‚úÖ TRUE 50/50 DETECTION WORKING

### Recent Success (Current Session)
- **True 50/50 Detection**: Successfully implemented with Python + Dart validation
- **Python Algorithm**: Finds cells with 0.5 probability and groups them into side-adjacent pairs
- **Dart Validation**: Post-processes Python results to ensure cells share a revealed neighbor
- **Validation Logic**: Only accepts pairs where both cells are side-adjacent to the same revealed number
- **Debug Output**: Shows clear validation results - "True 50/50 confirmed" vs "No shared revealed neighbor found"

### Current Challenge: Mine Number Calculation
**Issue**: When a mine is revealed during 50/50 safe move, the cell appears blank with no number
**Requirement**: Calculate what number should be displayed in the mine cell
**Constraints**: 
- Must be minimal blast radius (only affect the specific cell)
- Only for last single cell revealed during 50/50 safe move
- Must maintain game consistency

### Technical Implementation Status

#### Python Integration ‚úÖ
- **Embedded Python**: Working with proper environment setup
- **50/50 Detection**: `find_5050_situations_simple()` finds potential pairs
- **Side-adjacent Logic**: Only accepts cells that are side-adjacent (not corner-adjacent)
- **Multiple Pairs**: Can find and return multiple 50/50 pairs in one call

#### Dart Validation ‚úÖ
- **Post-processing**: `_findTrue5050Pairs()` validates Python results
- **Shared Neighbor Check**: Ensures both cells in pair share a revealed neighbor
- **Board State Integration**: Uses actual game state for validation
- **Debug Logging**: Clear output showing validation results

#### Safe Move Implementation ‚úÖ
- **50/50 Safe Move**: `perform5050SafeMove()` selects one cell from validated pair
- **Game State Update**: Properly updates board state after safe move
- **UI Feedback**: Shows safe move completion and game status

### Key Files Modified
- `ios/Runner/Resources/find_5050.py` - Python 50/50 detection algorithm
- `lib/presentation/providers/game_provider.dart` - Dart validation and safe move logic
- `ios/Runner/PythonMinimalRunner.swift` - Python environment setup

### Next Steps
1. **Implement Mine Number Calculation**: Add logic to calculate proper number for revealed mine cells
2. **Safety Constraints**: Ensure calculation only happens for 50/50 safe moves
3. **Minimal Impact**: Limit calculation to only the specific mine cell
4. **Testing**: Verify calculation accuracy and game consistency

### Debug Output Examples
```
üîç GameProvider: True 50/50 confirmed: cells (0, 2) and (0, 3) share revealed neighbor (1, 2) with value 2
üîç GameProvider: No shared revealed neighbor found for cells (5, 9) and (5, 8)
üîç GameProvider: Validation complete: 2 cells in 1 true pairs
```

### Architecture Notes
- **Python**: Handles probability calculation and initial pair detection
- **Dart**: Handles board state validation and safe move execution
- **Swift**: Bridges communication between Flutter and Python
- **Validation**: Two-stage process (Python + Dart) ensures accuracy
