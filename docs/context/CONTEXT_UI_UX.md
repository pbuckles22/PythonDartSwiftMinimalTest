# UI/UX Implementation Context

## Current UI Features

### ✅ **What Works**
- ✅ Minesweeper UI fully functional
- ✅ Feature flags system
- ✅ Settings persistence
- ✅ **Debug Probability Mode** - Interactive probability analysis with visual highlighting
- ✅ **Conditional Debug UI** - Debug buttons only show when feature flag is enabled
- ✅ **Long-press Behavior** - Coordinates shown in snackbar, probability analysis on cells
- ✅ **Visual Improvements** - Clean UI without coordinate text artifacts
- ✅ **Haptic Feedback Optimization** - Only triggers when appropriate
- ✅ **Scroll position bug fixes**
- ✅ **Board movement optimizations**

### ❌ **What Doesn't Work**
- ❌ **Horizontal phone game support** - UI not optimized for landscape orientation

## Key UI Implementation Files

### Flutter Files
- `lib/main.dart` - UI and method channel calls
- `lib/presentation/providers/game_provider.dart` - Game state management
- `lib/presentation/providers/settings_provider.dart` - Settings management
- `lib/presentation/pages/game_page.dart` - Main game UI
- `lib/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart` - Settings UI
- `lib/presentation/widgets/cell_widget.dart` - Individual cell rendering
- `lib/presentation/widgets/game_board.dart` - Board layout
- `lib/presentation/widgets/game_over_dialog.dart` - Game end dialog

### Configuration Files
- `assets/config/game_modes.json` - Feature flags and defaults
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies and assets

## UI/UX Issues and Solutions

### 1. Settings not persisting after app restart
**Root Cause**: `_saveSettings()` was empty placeholder
**Solution**: Implemented proper `SharedPreferences` integration (later removed for defaults)

### 2. Difficulty setting bug - app starts with EASY even when HARD is default
**Root Cause**: Asynchronous loading and misaligned default values
**Solution**: Synchronous loading from JSON config and aligned default values

### 3. "Double Initialization Problem" with FeatureFlags
**Root Cause**: `SettingsProvider` was overwriting `FeatureFlags` set by `main.dart`
**Solution**: Removed redundant `FeatureFlags` updates from `SettingsProvider`

### 4. Asset loading issues
**Root Cause**: Missing `assets` declaration in `pubspec.yaml`
**Solution**: Uncommented assets section and added `assets/config/`

## Feature Flags System

### Configuration
- Controlled by `assets/config/game_modes.json`
- Loaded in `main.dart` and set as global `FeatureFlags`
- Includes: `enableFirstClickGuarantee`, `enable5050Detection`, `enable5050SafeMove`

### Key Fix: Double Initialization Problem
- `main.dart` sets `FeatureFlags` from JSON
- `SettingsProvider` was redundantly setting them again
- Fixed by removing `FeatureFlags` updates from `SettingsProvider`

## Visual Feedback System

### 50/50 Detection Visual Feedback
- 50/50 cells highlighted with orange border and help icon
- Only shown when `FeatureFlags.enable5050Detection` is true
- Interactive probability analysis with visual highlighting

### Debug Mode Features
- Conditional debug UI that only shows when feature flag is enabled
- Long-press behavior showing coordinates in snackbar
- Probability analysis on cells with visual feedback

### Haptic Feedback
- Optimized to only trigger when appropriate
- Integrated with game actions for better user experience

## Settings Management

### Current Settings
- Game difficulty (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD)
- Feature flags for various game modes
- Debug mode settings

### Persistence Strategy
- Settings loaded from JSON configuration
- Default values aligned across all components
- Synchronous loading to prevent initialization issues

## UI Architecture

### Provider Pattern
- `GameProvider` manages game state and logic
- `SettingsProvider` manages settings and configuration
- Clean separation of concerns between UI and business logic

### Widget Structure
- `GamePage` contains the main game interface
- `GameBoard` handles board layout and cell positioning
- `CellWidget` renders individual cells with proper state management
- `GameOverDialog` provides end-game feedback

## Responsive Design

### Current Limitations
- UI not optimized for landscape orientation
- Fixed layout that doesn't adapt to different screen sizes
- No tablet-specific optimizations

### Future Improvements Needed
- Landscape orientation support
- Responsive grid layout
- Tablet-optimized interface
- Dynamic cell sizing based on screen size

## Accessibility

### Current Features
- Basic touch interaction
- Visual feedback for game states
- Haptic feedback for important actions

### Areas for Improvement
- VoiceOver support
- High contrast mode
- Larger touch targets for accessibility
- Screen reader compatibility

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- Scroll position bug fixes
- Board movement optimizations
- Efficient cell rendering
- Optimized state management

### Future Optimizations
- Lazy loading for large boards
- Memory management for long game sessions
- Animation performance improvements
- Battery usage optimization
