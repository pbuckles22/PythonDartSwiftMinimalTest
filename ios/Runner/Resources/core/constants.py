"""
Constants for the Minesweeper environment.

Recent Updates (2024-12-19):
- Simplified reward system: Immediate rewards for all actions (no first-move special cases)
- Enhanced state representation: 4-channel state for better pattern recognition
- Cross-platform compatibility: Platform-specific requirements and test adaptations
- M1 GPU optimization: Automatic device detection and performance benchmarking

Key Changes:
- Removed confusing first-move neutral rewards
- Implemented immediate positive/negative feedback for all actions
- Added 4-channel state representation (game state, safety hints, revealed count, progress)
- Enhanced action masking for better learning guidance
